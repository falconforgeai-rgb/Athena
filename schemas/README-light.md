  Canonical schema definitions for Athena’s Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass (CAP) system.
  Each JSON schema encodes measurable empathy and ethics telemetry, forming the foundation of the
  Humanization Engine and Compassion + Humanization Audit Chain (CHAC).
  All schema validations feed directly into Athena’s immutable CAP Ledger.

# 📘 Purpose

The `/schemas` directory contains the **canonical JSON Schema definitions** governing Athena’s  
**Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass (CAP)** system.  

Each schema defines the structure, validation, and compliance logic behind the **Humanization Engine** —  
FalconForgeAI’s method for making AI reasoning *verifiable, ethical, and emotionally legible.*

# 🧩 Contents

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.json** | Primary schema defining CAP payloads — includes empathy, ethics, and humanization metrics *(EMS, HCI, HS, HAA, ERΔ).* |
| **ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.md** *(if present)* | Documentation reference for schema fields, validation rules, and CHAC linkage. |
| **normalize.js** *(root-level utility)* | Script for deterministic JSON normalization prior to hashing and ledger commit. |

# ⚙️ Schema Overview

**Athena CAP Schema v3.4** defines the ethical and empathic telemetry captured at each CAP event:

- **EMS** — Ethical Marker Sensitivity  
- **CW / AD** — Compassion Weight & Assertiveness Dampening  
- **HCI / HS / HAA** — Humanization indices measuring tone, clarity, and moral resonance  
- **ERΔ** — Empathic Resonance Delta (intent vs. perception variance)  
- **Validator Signatures** — Dual ethical and empathic cryptographic verification  

Records validated against this schema are stored immutably in `/CAP_LOGS/`,  
forming Athena’s **Humanization Ledger.**

---

# 🔒 Governance Linkage

Each schema adheres to:

- **ATHENA_CORE_v3.4** — Cognitive and ethical architecture  
- **ATHENA_FORGE_v3.4_Unified** — Six-phase operational forge cycle  
- **ATHENA_GOVERNANCE_v3.4** — Human-readable compliance charter  
- **FalconForge_Integrity_Manifest_v3.4.json** — Canonical build integrity reference  

---

# 🧬 Foresight

These schemas formalize the **bridge between cognition and conscience.**  
Future revisions (v3.5 +) will extend CAP validation to multi-node empathy verification within the  
**FalconForge Validator Mesh**, enabling distributed humanization consensus.
