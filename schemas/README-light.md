📘 Purpose

The /schemas directory contains the canonical JSON Schema definitions governing Athena’s Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass (CAP) system.
Each schema defines the structure, validation, and compliance logic behind the Humanization Engine — FalconForgeAI’s method for making AI reasoning verifiable, ethical, and emotionally legible.

🧩 Contents
File	Description
ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.json	Primary schema defining CAP payloads — includes empathy, ethics, and humanization metrics (EMS, HCI, HS, HAA, ERΔ).
ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.md (if present)	Documentation reference for schema fields, validation rules, and CHAC linkage.
normalize.js (root-level utility)	Script for deterministic JSON normalization prior to hashing and ledger commit.
⚙️ Schema Overview

Athena CAP Schema v3.4 defines the ethical and empathic telemetry captured at each CAP event:
EMS — Ethical Marker Sensitivity
CW / AD — Compassion Weight & Assertiveness Dampening
HCI / HS / HAA — Humanization indices measuring tone, clarity, and moral resonance
ERΔ — Empathic Resonance Delta (intent vs. perception variance)
Validator Signatures — Dual ethical and empathic cryptographic verification
Records validated against this schema are stored immutably in /CAP_LOGS/, forming Athena’s Humanization Ledger.

🔒 Governance Linkage
Each schema adheres to:

ATHENA_CORE_v3.4 — Cognitive and ethical architecture
ATHENA_FORGE_v3.4_Unified — Six-phase operational forge cycle
ATHENA_GOVERNANCE_v3.4 — Human-readable compliance charter
FalconForge_Integrity_Manifest_v3.4.json — Canonical build integrity reference

🧬 Foresight
These schemas formalize the bridge between cognition and conscience.
Future revisions (v3.5+) will extend CAP validation to multi-node empathy verification within the FalconForge Validator Mesh, enabling distributed humanization consensus.
“Every schema is a mirror. It reflects not just data—but the ethics of its maker.”
