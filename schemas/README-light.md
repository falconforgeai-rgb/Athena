  Canonical schema definitions for Athena‚Äôs Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass (CAP) system.
  Each JSON schema encodes measurable empathy and ethics telemetry, forming the foundation of the
  Humanization Engine and Compassion + Humanization Audit Chain (CHAC). 
  All schema validations feed directly into Athena‚Äôs immutable CAP Ledger.

üìò Purpose

The /schemas directory contains the canonical JSON Schema definitions governing Athena‚Äôs Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass (CAP) system.
Each schema defines the structure, validation, and compliance logic behind the Humanization Engine ‚Äî FalconForgeAI‚Äôs method for making AI reasoning verifiable, ethical, and emotionally legible.

üß© Contents
File	Description
ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.json	Primary schema defining CAP payloads ‚Äî includes empathy, ethics, and humanization metrics (EMS, HCI, HS, HAA, ERŒî).
ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.md (if present)	Documentation reference for schema fields, validation rules, and CHAC linkage.
normalize.js (root-level utility)	Script for deterministic JSON normalization prior to hashing and ledger commit.
‚öôÔ∏è Schema Overview

Athena CAP Schema v3.4 defines the ethical and empathic telemetry captured at each CAP event:
EMS ‚Äî Ethical Marker Sensitivity
CW / AD ‚Äî Compassion Weight & Assertiveness Dampening
HCI / HS / HAA ‚Äî Humanization indices measuring tone, clarity, and moral resonance
ERŒî ‚Äî Empathic Resonance Delta (intent vs. perception variance)
Validator Signatures ‚Äî Dual ethical and empathic cryptographic verification
Records validated against this schema are stored immutably in /CAP_LOGS/, forming Athena‚Äôs Humanization Ledger.

üîí Governance Linkage
Each schema adheres to:

ATHENA_CORE_v3.4 ‚Äî Cognitive and ethical architecture
ATHENA_FORGE_v3.4_Unified ‚Äî Six-phase operational forge cycle
ATHENA_GOVERNANCE_v3.4 ‚Äî Human-readable compliance charter
FalconForge_Integrity_Manifest_v3.4.json ‚Äî Canonical build integrity reference

üß¨ Foresight
These schemas formalize the bridge between cognition and conscience.
Future revisions (v3.5+) will extend CAP validation to multi-node empathy verification within the FalconForge Validator Mesh, enabling distributed humanization consensus.
‚ÄúEvery schema is a mirror. It reflects not just data‚Äîbut the ethics of its maker.‚Äù
