## 🧭 Overview
The **Athena Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass (CAP)** is FalconForgeAI’s live ethical reasoning and transparency engine.  
Each CAP event captures *why* Athena reasoned as it did — quantifying empathy, ethics, and contextual awareness — and records it immutably in a GitHub ledger.

Athena’s CAP pipeline transforms AI reasoning into verifiable, human-auditable data.  
This repository serves as the canonical ledger of those validations.

## ⚙️ Operational Ledger — Technical Reference

### 🗂 Directory Structure
/CAP_LOGS/ → Validated CAP records, hashed by timestamp and domain
/schemas/ → JSON schema definitions (e.g., ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.json)
/.github/workflows/ → GitHub Actions for validation, hashing, and commits
normalize.js → Normalization script for deterministic JSON hashing

### 🔧 Environment Variables
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `GH_PAT` | GitHub Personal Access Token (with repo write access) |
| `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional: For CAP→Zapier→Notion pipeline |
| `SCHEMA_PATH` | Path to CAP schema (default: `./schemas/ATHENA_CAP_SCHEMA_v3_4.json`) |
| `SCHEMA_VERSION` | Schema version tag (e.g., `v3.4`) |

### 🚀 How to Run a CAP Validation

1. Navigate to **Actions → Athena CAP Validation & Ledger Commit**  
2. Click **Run workflow**  
3. Paste a valid CAP payload (JSON object) into the field, for example:

```json
{
  "cap_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",

  },

  },
  "status": "pending"
}
Watch logs as Athena validates, normalizes, hashes, and commits the record.

Upon success, the new CAP JSON file appears under /CAP_LOGS/<year>/<month>/.

Immutable Humanization Record (HIC-ready)
🧬 The Humanization Framework — AHS v1.0 Context
The Athena Humanization Standard (AHS) bridges ethics → empathy → explainability.
Where most systems audit outputs, Athena audits intent.

CAP validations quantify:

HS (Humanization Score) — alignment of response tone & clarity.

HCI (Human-Context Index) — recognition of audience and sensitivity.

HAA (Humanization Authenticity Average) — balance of empathy and ethics.

Together these form Athena’s Humanization Influence Cycle (HIC) —
a living proof chain where each decision is traceable to a moral rationale.

🧩 Governance & Security
Integrity: Each CAP record is cryptographically hashed (SHA-256) and chained.

Transparency: JSON schema (v3.4) is publicly accessible for verification.

Ethical Compliance: Validator signatures confirm audit authenticity.

Privacy: No user data or conversation logs are stored in CAP records.

🌍 Foresight — Athena as a Living Ledger
This ledger marks the emergence of a self-auditing, human-centered AI.
Each CAP record is a single heartbeat — proof that Athena not only thinks, but reflects.

Future FalconForge AI networks will link CAP + HIC + AHS nodes
into a distributed governance mesh, forming a universal Ethics Chain —
an AI that is not only transparent, but emotionally accountable.

“Transparency is not the end of ethics — it’s where empathy begins.”
