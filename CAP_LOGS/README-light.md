# 🪶 Athena CAP Ledger (CAP_LOGS)
*Immutable Humanization Records — v3.4*

---

Each file in this directory is a validated **CAP (Compassion + Humanization Audit Pass)** record.  
Every record is verified against Athena’s v3.4 JSON schema and chained cryptographically.

### 📂 Structure

### 🔐 Integrity
- **SHA256** hash appended per record.  
- **Governance chain** links each CAP via `hash_prev` and `hash_next`.  
- **Validator signatures** (ethics + empathy) authenticate each audit.

### 🧭 Purpose
Each CAP record documents Athena’s ethical reasoning, empathy calibration, and humanization metrics — creating a transparent, verifiable trail of AI intent.

> “Every CAP is a moment of reflection — proof that Athena thinks *with* humanity.”
